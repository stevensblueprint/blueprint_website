faqs:
  - question: "What is the time commitment for each team?"
    answer: |
      **Project Teams:** The commitment is similar to taking a course at Stevens. There are typically weekly 1-hour meetings, and the rest of the work is asynchronous. Building software takes time, so you should expect to dedicate 4-10 a week to your project!

      **Internal Teams:** Time commitments are a lot more flexible. You can choose your level of involvement. However, if you pick up a task on a specific project, you will be expected to complete it in a timely manner. Both the Tech and Design Teams have meetings (not mandatory) where members can receive tasks and ask questions.
  - question: "What are the responsibilities of each project team role?"
    answer: |
      Project teams are comprised of technical leads, project managers, developers, and designers.
      * Tech Leads – Oversee the project's technical implementation, including architecture, infrastructure, and deployment. They ensure the software is scalable, maintainable, and integrates effectively with cloud platforms.
      * Developers – Build the project by writing, reviewing, and testing code in various languages and frameworks. They work on both frontend and backend development to turn designs into functional products.
      * Designers – Conduct user research, create wireframes, and design UI/UX using tools like Figma. They ensure the final product is intuitive, accessible, and aligns with the nonprofit’s needs.
      * Product Managers – Act as the liaison between the team and the nonprofit, managing communication, feature scoping, and user feedback. They write user stories and help keep projects on track using Agile methodologies.

      Check out our [Wiki](https://wiki.sitblueprint.com/) for more information on each role!
  - question: "When are project team applications?"
    answer: |
      Project team applications occur during the Spring Semester and typically span the whole month of March. Students who complete the application process and are selected will join projects starting in the following Fall Semester.
  - question: "How do I join the Tech or Design Team?"
    answer: |
      Reach out to blueprint@stevens.edu and we’ll get back to you so you can join the Discord server! The Tech and Design Team are open year-round, and the goal of these teams is to allow students to learn at their own pace while contributing to Blueprint.
  - question: "Can I join project teams as a freshman?"
    answer: |
      Since the applications for project teams occur in the Spring, freshmen are typically unable to join their first year. **However,** there are often a couple of members who drop from the project teams, and if you are active on the Internal Teams and express an interest to join, we may reach out to help fill the gaps!
