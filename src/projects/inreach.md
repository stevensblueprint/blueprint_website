npoDescription: |
  InReach has verified services for LGBTQ+ asylum seekers, refugees and other immigrants, LGBTQ+ Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities, the transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) community, LGBTQ+ youth and their caregivers, and more LGBTQ+ communities.
projectDescription: |
  Revamp and modernize the current InReach website to visually align with the free mobile InReach app. Their current website is hosted using WordPress, which is causing latency, so the new project will have to provide an integrated management system (CMS) that allows non-technical InReach members to modify and update the website with reusable components.
