  NYC Mesh is dedicated to bridging the digital divide in New York City by providing an open, resilient, and community-driven internet network. Their mission is to ensure affordable and reliable internet access for all residents, independent of commercial providers. By building and maintaining a decentralized, neutral network, NYC Mesh empowers communities with unrestricted connectivity, safeguarding privacy and autonomy while offering a crucial alternative during internet disruptions or emergencies.
projectDescription: |
  To enhance the reliability of NYC Mesh’s decentralized network, Blueprint developed a node planning web interface that helps volunteers optimize antenna configurations. The platform maps all existing antennas, calculates potential interference based on location and direction, and allows users to simulate frequency adjustments. This tool enables NYC Mesh’s install team to proactively prevent service disruptions by ensuring that new antenna placements do not degrade network performance. By streamlining installation planning and reducing frequency conflicts, this solution helps expand internet access while maintaining a high-quality mesh network for communities across New York City.
