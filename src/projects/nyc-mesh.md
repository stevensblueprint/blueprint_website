npoDescription: |
  NYC Mesh is an organization dedicated to bridging the digital divide in New York City by
  providign high-speed reliable internet access. They host and build neutral internet networks
  that allows residents to connect without monitoring, data collection, content blocking, preserving
  user privacy and autonomy.
projectDescription: |
  NYC Mesh manages and installs antennas to provide free internet service across the different boroughs in New York City. Each antenna produces an area of service availability called the sector lobe. The sector lobe points in the same direction as the antenna is directed; however, if the sector lobes of two different antennas overlap, they can cause interference, thereby reducing the service availability in the area. To manage this, we created a web application that lets NYC Mesh members modify the direction and frequencies of the antennas to verify that new installations do not break the service availability in certain areas.
