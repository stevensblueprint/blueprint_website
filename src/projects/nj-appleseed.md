projectDescription: |
  Medical debt is a growing crisis affecting millions of Americans, often pushing families into financial hardship. NJ Appleseed is partnering with Blueprint to develop an accessible, user-friendly website that will serve as a critical resource for New Jersey residents dealing with medical billing and debt collection. This platform will provide downloadable legal guides, sample forms, FAQs, and video tutorials to help individuals navigate medical debt disputes, insurance appeals, and payment negotiations. The site will also connect users with legal aid services and resources, making it easier for them to access the support they need. By streamlining access to this vital information, the project aims to reduce the burden of medical debt and empower individuals to protect their financial well-being.
