projectDescription: |
  Our project focuses on rebuilding GenXL's website to create a modern, responsive, and scalable platform. We aim to replicate the existing design and structure of the current GenXL site while integrating a powerful backend dashboard that enables real-time SEO management, analytics tracking, and content updates without technical barriers. By incorporating tools like Google Analytics and Search Console, along with a custom CMS, GenXL will be able to monitor performance, optimize discoverability, and better communicate their impact. This project will allow us to expand our digital footprint, reach a larger global audience, and provide accessible educational resources to the students, educators, and partners.
