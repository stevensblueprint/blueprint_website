projectDescription: |
  Blueprint is building a new data administration interface that allows non-profit organizations to efficiently create, update, and manage HSDS-compliant datasets. This tool will support database CRUD operations, user management, taxonomy structuring, and data import/export while seamlessly integrating with other open-source HSDS tools like Connect211 for public-facing directories. By modernizing the management of human service data, this open-source project will enhance resource accessibility, streamline social service referrals, and improve interoperability within the Open Referral ecosystem.
