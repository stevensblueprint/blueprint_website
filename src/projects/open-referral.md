npoDescription: |
  Open Referral  develops open data standards and open-source tools to make information about health, human, and social services easier to share and use. By promoting interoperability through its Human Service Data Specifications (HSDS), Open Referral helps organizations reduce costs, accelerate standardization, and improve access to vital community resources.
projectDescription: |
  Our project with Open Referral focuses on building an HSDS Transformer, a tool that will simplify the process of converting non-standard service directory data into the Human Service Data Specification (HSDS) format. This transformer will allow technical users to script schema mappings and run automated transformations, while also aiming to provide a user-friendly interface so non-technical users can perform the same tasks without coding. By reducing the time and expertise required to standardize data, the tool will help organizations adopt HSDS more easily, enabling them to share interoperable data across systems and partners.
