npoDescription: |
    Asian American Dream empowers underserved Asian American and Pacific Islander undergraduates through career-centric mentorship and professional development opportunities.
projectDescription: |
    AAD hosts an annual event where mentees can meet their potential mentors. At the end of the event, the mentees and mentors rank their preferences. AAD processes the mentor rankings manually, which takes over 48 hours of manual matching each year. The project aims to design a matching algorithm for AAD's KIN mentorship program and a directory that allows mentors and mentees to view each other's profiles.
