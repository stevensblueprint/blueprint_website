npoDescription: |
  Asian American Dream (AAD) is dedicated to empowering underserved Asian American and Pacific Islander undergraduates by providing career-focused mentorship and professional development opportunities. Their signature KIN Mentorship Program fosters meaningful connections between students and industry professionals, helping mentees explore career paths, build confidence, and gain the skills needed to succeed. Over the course of a 12-month program, participants develop a sense of community, unlock the power of cultural kinship, and work toward achieving milestone career goals. Through mentorship, AAD inspires students to dream big and equips them with the tools to turn those aspirations into reality.
projectDescription: |
  Matching mentees with the right mentors is a critical component of AADâ€™s KIN Mentorship Program, but the manual pairing process required over 48 hours of work each year. To streamline this process, Blueprint developed an automated matching system based on the Gale-Shapley Algorithm, ensuring that mentees and mentors are paired based on their ranked preferences and relevant industry experience. The system processes participant submissions, applies similarity scoring based on selected criteria, and generates optimal matches efficiently. Additionally, a user-friendly directory allows mentors and mentees to browse profiles, fostering better engagement within the program. This solution significantly reduces administrative workload while improving the quality and fairness of mentor-mentee pairings.
