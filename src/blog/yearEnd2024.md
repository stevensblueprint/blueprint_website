As the spring semester comes to an end, we reflect on our work for the 2023-2024 school year. Our project teams partnered with Asian American Dream and NYC Mesh to do some really amazing things.

## Asian American Dream

Here is a brief summary of what Blueprint did with Asian American Dream, the progress that has been made, and where we still have to go to complete this project.

## NYC Mesh

Here, once again, is a brief summary of what Blueprint did with NYC Mesh, the progress made, and where we still have to go.

## Internal Projects

Here, once again, a brief summary of what the Tech Team did this year, including current internal projects, and where we still have to go.

## Final Thoughts

Thank you to everyone who worked hard to get this done this year. Everyone is amazing and deserves more praise than I know.

Goodbye to 2023-2024 and here's to everything we will accomplish next!
