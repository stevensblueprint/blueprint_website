    In September of 2021, Blueprint was just a dream that Simon Gao, Max Shi, and Hamzah Nizami all shared. Inspired by Blueprint chapters at other universities, they wanted to bring the same organization to Stevens. Blueprint would connect project teams of Stevens students to non-profit organizations (NPOs) to provide software solutions free of charge. However, all three of them were seniors, and not able to make Blueprint a fully registered organization (RSO) before graduating. Little did they know that they would lay the groundwork for what Blueprint has become in just two years, an organization with over 60 members that has worked on projects for five NPOs thus far.
