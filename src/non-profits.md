    "Partnering with the Stevens Blueprint team to transform our organization's homesite from WordPress to Next.js was a great experience. Their expertise and dedication resulted in a modern, user-friendly website with a streamlined backend CMS. This upgrade will empower our staff and volunteers to easily manage updates, ensuring our homesite stays relevant and impactful for years to come."

projectTimeline:
  - title: "Phase 1: Introductions"
    description: |
      In the initial stages of our project timeline, we'd like to meet and discuss your organization's mission, the project idea, and what we can do to help. We ask that organizations provide a proposal that details the requested project. Not everything has to be fleshed out, since we are open to collaborative scoping, but we would like as much detail as possible so we can decide whether or not this project is feasible for our team.
  - title: "Phase 2: Development"
    description: |
      To start the development process, we pair our organizations with the teams that will deliver the project by the end of the timeline. There is one project team per organization, composed of technical leads, project managers, software developers, and user experience designers. Organization representatives can expect to receive status updates and feedback every 2 weeks during scheduled meetings throughout the year.
  - title: "Phase 3: Handoff"
    description: |
      Once we reach the end of the timeline, our project teams would have created a minimum viable product (MVP) through a constant feedback loop between our team members and organization. The objective of the final phase is to provide instructions on how to deploy the provided software and conduct basic maintenance going forward. Blueprint is not responsible for maintaining the project after the collaboration period ends.

  - question: "Do Blueprint projects cost money?"
    answer: |
      No, all our work is pro bono! However, there may be minor costs associated with deploying and hosting the software, which will be the responsibility of the nonprofit organization.
  - question: "Does Blueprint maintain the software after its completed?"
    answer: |
      Blueprint does not provide ongoing maintenance after the handoff phase. We will, however, provide documentation, instructions, and support with the initial deployment.
  - question: "Does Blueprint work with website building tools like Wordpress or Wix?"
    answer: |
      No, we do not work with WordPress or Wix. Instead, we build custom websites that often include advanced features, offering a technical challenge to our members.
