    "Partnering with the Stevens Blueprint team to transform our organization's homesite from WordPress to Next.js was a great experience. Their expertise and dedication resulted in a modern, user-friendly website with a streamlined backend CMS. This upgrade will empower our staff and volunteers to easily manage updates, ensuring our homesite stays relevant and impactful for years to come."

projectTimeline:
  - title: "Phase 1: Introductions"
    description: |
      We begin by understanding your organizationâ€™s mission, goals, and technical needs. Organizations submit a detailed proposal, and we work together to refine the project scope. Our teams assess feasibility and determine the best approach before officially kicking off development. The project runs for one year, with a Minimum Viable Product targeted for Winter and a final product by Spring.
  - title: "Phase 2: Development"
    description: |
      Each nonprofit is paired with a dedicated team of tech leads, developers, designers, and product managers. Teams follow an iterative process, incorporating feedback through bi-weekly check-ins with organization representatives. These meetings ensure transparency, align expectations, and allow us to make adjustments as needed to keep the project on track for successful completion.
  - title: "Phase 3: Handoff"
    description: |
      By the final phase, the team delivers a fully developed product alongside deployment and maintenance instructions. Blueprint does not take 
      responsibility for hosting after the final delivery. However, we will provide your organization with all the resource to ensure your project can be maintained and hosted by your team.
