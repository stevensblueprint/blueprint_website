    "My experience working with the Blueprint team at Stevens was phenomenal. The task at hand was to develop a matching algorithm that would streamline the matching process for our signature, Kin Mentorship Program. Blueprint was able to develop a tailored algorithm that effectively matched our 200 mentees and 200 mentors based on ranking, industry, and mentorship style preferences. Our previous matching process was completely manual, taking days to complete. Blueprint revolutionized our matching process to create exceptional mentor-mentee matches, nearly instantaneously."
